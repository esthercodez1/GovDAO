;; Title: Governance DAO Smart Contract

;; Summary:
;; This smart contract implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for governance purposes.
;; It allows stakeholders to propose, vote on, and execute decisions in a transparent and decentralized manner.

;; Description:
;; The Governance DAO Smart Contract is designed to facilitate decentralized decision-making within a community or organization.
;; It includes functionalities for proposing new initiatives, voting on proposals, and executing approved decisions.
;; The contract ensures that all actions are transparent and verifiable on the blockchain, promoting trust and
;; accountability among participants. Key features include:
;; - Proposal creation and management
;; - Voting mechanisms with configurable parameters
;; - Execution of approved proposals
;; - Role-based access control for administrative functions
;; - Event logging for transparency and auditability
