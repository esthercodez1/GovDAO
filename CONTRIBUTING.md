# Contributing to Governance DAO Smart Contract

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Governance DAO Smart Contract as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/get-started/using-github/github-flow.md)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Smart Contract Development Guidelines

1. **Security First**

   - Always prioritize security in your changes
   - Follow established security patterns
   - Add appropriate checks and validations

2. **Code Style**

   - Follow Clarity best practices
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep functions focused and modular

3. **Testing**

   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Ensure existing tests pass
   - Test edge cases and failure scenarios

4. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation for any changes
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Update error code documentation

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
